# Discord-Spinning-Donut-Bot
codebase for a bot that spins a donut in python

Note: I am not the original creator of the math that the script uses, I only interpreted it into a discord bot. Some code may be arbitrary. The code in c can be found here https://www.dropbox.com/s/79ga2m7p2bnj1ga/donut_deobfuscated.c?dl=0. I used another repo that converted it from c to python.
